# 👋 About Me

I'm a self-hosting enthusiast running Proxmox with a growing collection of open source applications. My tech journey started with BASIC programs from Byte Magazine and hand-coded HTML, and now I'm diving into modern development with React, Tailwind, and Python.

## 🔧 Current Setup
- Self-hosted infrastructure on Proxmox/Debian
- Exploring containerization and automation
- Building real projects to learn modern web and application development

## 💡 Interests
- AI/ML from technical, practical, and philosophical angles
- Science, theoretical physics, and the intersection of computing and physics
- Sci-fi and retro futurism—where we thought we'd be vs. where we are vs. where we should be.
- Computer hardware architecture and optimization
- Open source software and self-hosting solutions
- Gaming since the Atari 2600 era (currently Xbox Series X)

## 🌱 Learning Journey

I bring decades of Windows expertise and systems thinking to my development learning curve. I'm building competency through hands-on projects rather than theoretical knowledge—learning by doing, voiding warranties, breaking things and (hopefully) fixing them.

## ⚛️ Currently living in the heart of the Manhattan Project

Always happy to connect with people who remember when "multimedia" meant the choice between a 3.5-inch floppy disc and a CD-R
