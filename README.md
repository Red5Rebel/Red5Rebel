## About Me
I'm a self-hosting enthusiast running Proxmox with more than a few open source applications occupying VMs and LXCs. My tech journey started long, long ago in what seems like a galaxy far, far away - spending my early-mid childhood days with my Dad over my shoulder as we learned Atari BASIC language through programming tutorials in Compute! & BYTE Magazine together. Now, after crossing the line into middle age, I spend my free time building real projects to learn modern web and application development, along with exploring containerization and automation. I'm about to venture into the world of modern development with ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, Python etc. (wish me luck!)

### :desktop_computer: Current Setup
- Self-hosted infrastructure on 3 Proxmox 9 hosts
- Windows 11 Pro daily driver
- Use Debian Linux and Proxmox every day
- Do everything in my power to keep it FOSS where I can
### :computer: The Tech I'm Into
- Computer hardware architecture and optimization
- Open source software and self-hosting
- AI/ML from technical, practical, and philosophical angles
### What I dig
#### :alien: Sci-Fi and RetroFuturism
- Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope & Tron (1982) sparked my love for all things geeky when I was around 4 years old.
#### :joystick: Gaming
- Started in the Atari 2600 era (currently rock an Xbox Series X)
#### :satellite: Science
- Theoretcal Physics
- String Theory
- The origins of life
- The search for extraterrestrial intelligence
  
### :rocket: What I know
I bring decades of Windows expertise (Hello, Windows 3.1) and systems thinking to my development learning curve. I'm building competency through hands-on projects, learning by doing, voiding warranties, breaking things and (hopefully) fixing them.

### :radioactive: Where I am
Currently living in the Secret City at the heart of the Manhattan Project

*Always happy to connect with self-hosters, open source developers, and people who remember when "multimedia" meant the choice between a 3.5-inch floppy disc, Zip Disk or a CD-R*
