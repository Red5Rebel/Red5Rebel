# 👋 "Hello, World!"

About Me

I'm a self-hosting enthusiast running Proxmox with more than a few open source applications occupying VMs and LXCs. My tech journey started long, long ago in what seems like a galaxy far, far away - spending my early-mid childhood days with my Dad over my shoulder as we learned Atari BASIC language through programming tutorials in Compute! & BYTE Magazine. Now, after crossing the line into middle age, I'm venturing into the world of modern development with ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, Python etc. (wish me luck!)

## :desktop_computer: Current Setup
- Self-hosted infrastructure on Proxmox 9
- Generally a Windows user, but totally dig Debian Linux
- Exploring containerization and automation
- Building real projects to learn modern web and application development

## :computer: Tech
- Computer hardware architecture and optimization
- Open source software and self-hosting
- AI/ML from technical, practical, and philosophical angles
## :alien: Sci-Fi and RetroFuturism
- Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope & Tron (1982) sparked my love for all things geeky when I was around 4 years old.
## :joystick: Gaming
- Started in the Atari 2600 era (currently rock an Xbox Series X)
## :satellite: Science
- Theoretcal Physics
- String Theory
- The origins of life
- The search for extraterrestrial intelligence
## :rocket: Learning Journey

I bring decades of Windows expertise (Hello, Windows 3.1) and systems thinking to my development learning curve. I'm building competency through hands-on projects—learning by doing, voiding warranties, breaking things and (hopefully) fixing them.

## ⚛️ Currently living in the Secret City at the heart of the Manhattan Project :radioactive:

Always happy to connect with self-hosters, open source developers, and people who remember when "multimedia" meant the choice between a :floppy_disk: 3.5-inch floppy disc and a CD-R :cd: (anyone remember Zip Drives?)
